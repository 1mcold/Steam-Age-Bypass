**Steam Age Bypass** is a lightweight browser extension that automatically skips the age verification screen on Steam store pages.  
Save time and enjoy smoother browsing without unnecessary clicks.


## 💡 Project Story

The idea came to me during a class — basically a career-oriented informatics lesson.  
We were watching people browse through games on Steam, and one of them kept clicking through the age verification popups.

At that moment, I thought:

> **"Why not make an extension that skips this annoying step completely?"**

A few lines of JavaScript later — **Steam Age Bypass** was born.


## 📋 Features

- 🗓️ Automatically inserts a default birth date (e.g. Jan 1, 1990)
